TODO:
  - Move generated treenode from profanity filter to static json, create a editor
    - this would allow for more advanced and precise targeting of filtering
    - would start from the generated filter, and be slowly modified to not target false positives
  - Use clean dictionary in profanity filter to avoid false positives
    - Determine resource impact of this
      - If too high, use a whitelist instead.
